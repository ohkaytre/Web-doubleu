## Style Guidelines:

- Background: A deep, muted indigo (#191D24) establishes a sophisticated and intimate atmosphere, reminiscent of classic dark tones in vintage media.
- Primary: A warm, inviting sepia brown (#C08F61) for headings, primary calls to action, and interactive elements, conveying nostalgia and warmth.

- Text: A delicate warm cream (#EDE9E0) for all body text, ensuring readability against the dark background while maintaining a timeless, aged aesthetic.
- Font: 'Alegreya' (humanist serif) for all text elements. Its elegant, contemporary, and intellectual feel complements the app's focus on storytelling and artistic content, suitable for both headlines and longer narratives.
- Custom-designed icons featuring subtle vintage styling, line art, or classic silhouettes, aligning with the music and nostalgia themes.
- A structured, gallery-like layout for 'Memory Lane' emphasizing visual content, combined with clear, spacious presentation for the music player and guestbook to allow focus on each feature.
